# Custom Templated Path Webpack Plugin

Webpack plugin for creating custom path template tags. Extend the [default set of template tags](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename) with your own custom behavior. Hooks into Webpack's compilation process to allow you to replace tags with a substitute value.

## Installation

Install the module

```bash
npm install @popup-maker/custom-templated-path-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

**Note**: This package requires Node.js 12.0.0 or later. It targets Webpack 4.0 and newer. It is not compatible with older versions.

## Usage

Construct an instance of `CustomTemplatedPathPlugin` in your Webpack configurations `plugins` entry, passing an object where keys correspond to the template tag name. The value for each key is a function passed the original intended path and data corresponding to the asset.

The following example creates a new `basename` tag to substitute the basename of each entry file in the build output file. When compiled, the built file will be output as `build-entry.js`.

```js
const { basename } = require( 'path' );
const CustomTemplatedPathPlugin = require( '@popup-maker/custom-templated-path-webpack-plugin' );

module.exports = {
 // ...

 entry: './entry',

 output: {
  filename: 'build-[basename].js',
 },

 plugins: [
  new CustomTemplatedPathPlugin( {
   basename( path, data ) {
    let rawRequest;

    const entryModule = get( data, [ 'chunk', 'entryModule' ], {} );
    switch ( entryModule.type ) {
     case 'javascript/auto':
      rawRequest = entryModule.rawRequest;
      break;

     case 'javascript/esm':
      rawRequest = entryModule.rootModule.rawRequest;
      break;
    }

    if ( rawRequest ) {
     return basename( rawRequest );
    }

    return path;
   },
  } ),
 ],
};
```

For more examples, refer to Webpack's own [`TemplatedPathPlugin.js`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/v4.1.1/lib/TemplatedPathPlugin.js), which implements the base set of template tags.
